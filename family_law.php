   <h2>DIVORCE</h2>
   <p>In Minnesota, divorce is called a &quot;Dissolution of Marriage.&quot; Minnesota is a no-fault divorce state, meaning that the parties don't have to prove that one was at fault or responsible for causing the divorce. However, the parties will have to address many complex issues such as the division of joint property, spousal maintenance, child support, and much more.</p>
   <p>It is important to have an experienced family law attorney on your side as you proceed forward with your divorce. Contact our office today to protect your interests as you proceed through the dissolution process.</p>
   <h2>CUSTODY &amp; PARENTING TIME</h2>
   <p>Our office is committed to assisting you establish the best custody and/or parenting time for you and your minor children. Minnesota Courts use the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; standard when determining custody found in Minnesota Statutes Section 518.17. The best interest factors are:</p>
   <ul><li>The wishes of the child's parent or parents as to custody</li>
     <li>The reasonable preference of the child, if the court deems the child to be of sufficient<br />
      Â  age to express preference</li>
     <li>The child's primary caretaker</li>
     <li>The intimacy of the relationship between each parent and the child</li>
     <li>The interaction and interrelationship of the child with a parent or parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interests</li>
     <li>The child's adjustment to home, school, and community</li>
     <li>The length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the desirability of maintaining continuity</li>
     <li>The permanence, as a family unit, of the existing or proposed custodial home</li>
     <li>The mental and physical health of all individuals involved</li>
     <li>The capacity and disposition of the parties to give the child love, affection, and guidance, and to continue educating and raising the child in the child's culture and religion or creed, if any</li>
     <li>The child's cultural background</li>
     <li>The effect on the child of the actions of an abuser</li>
     <li>The disposition of each parent to encourage and permit frequent and continuing contact by the other parent with the child</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Our office is committed to assisting you establish the best custody and/or parenting time for you and your minor children. Minnesota Courts use the &quot;best interests of the child&quot; standard when determining custody found in Minnesota Statutes Section 518.17. The best interest factors are:<br />
     The court cannot use one factor when making its determination and the primary caretaker factor cannot be used as a presumption in determining the best interests of the child.</p>
   </p>
   <p>Once custody has been established, custody can only be modified by one of the following, as found in Minnesota Statutes Section 518.18:<br />
   <ul>
      <li>A written agreement by the parties</li>
      <li>The court determines that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the parties, and that the modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child</li>
      <li>Minnesota Courts have determined that, &quot;The burden is upon the movant to establish satisfactorily...that there has occurred a significant change of circumstances...moreover, the significant change of circumstances must endanger the child's physical or emotional health or the child's development.&quot; Nice-Peterson v. Nice-Peterson, 310 N.W. 2d 471 (1981).</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>PATERNITY</h2>
   <p> A paternity action may be initiated for many reasons: if you have a child with someone to whom you are not married, if you need to verify whether you are the father of a child, if you believe you are the father of a child and want to become involved in this child's life.</p>
   <p> Whether you believe you are the father of a child and wish to become a part of this child's life or you are a mother who wants to identify the father of her child and establish his child support obligations, contact our office today and speak with an experienced family law attorney. <br />
   </p>
   <h2>CHILD SUPPORT</h2>
   <p><br />
     Both judges and magistrates rely heavily on the Minnesota Child Support Calculator in determining your child support obligation. However, it is possible to dispute this calculation. For example, if one parent is voluntarily unemployed, or underemployed, this has the potential to substantially affect the amount of support you are required to pay.</p>
   <p>Make sure that you are protected financially and the support you are ordered to pay is fair and reasonable. Contact our office today for more information.</p>
