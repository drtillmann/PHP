   <p>Mediation is a form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) which allows the parties to discuss the issues of the case in a more relaxed, less hostile environment and attempt to negotiate a settlement.</p>
   <h2>Family Mediation</h2>
   <p>Parties wishing to divorce may use a mediator prior to initiating a dissolution with the court or at any point during the dissolution process. Instead of the traditionally adversarial process of a court battle, mediation offers the parties a chance to communicate and negotiate with each other with the goal of coming to a resolution that is acceptable to both sides. Mediation offers the parties the ability to avoid the very expensive and lengthy court process and end their marriage relationship amicably. Contact our office today for more information and speak with a Qualified Neutral Family Mediator.</p>
   <p>A Parenting Consultant or Expeditor is often used when disagreements develop after the Court has awarded the parties a divorce. The Consultant or Expeditor assists the parties in resolving these disputes without additional litigation and/or court costs. Please contact Carlson Law Firm for more information.</p>
   <h2><br />
     Civil Mediation</h2>
   <p><br />
     Are you currently involved in a dispute, whether large or small, with another individual or organization? The goal of civil mediation is to solve these conflicts and avoid the time and expense of going to court. You do not have to initiate a lawsuit in order to engage in civil mediation. However, if you have initiated a lawsuit or already are a party to a lawsuit, courts strongly encourage mediation throughout the litigation process.</p>
<p>Mediation creates the ability for the parties to communicate and negotiate with one another to create a settlement agreement that is agreeable to both sides rather than leaving the entire matter up to a judge or jury. Not only does mediation cost a fraction of a court trial, but it also allows the parties to resolve things quickly and amicably. Contact our office today to speak with a Qualified Neutral Civil Mediator.</p>
